# Mexican-Hat-Detection
An innovative approach for sustainable wind turbine predictive maintenance that leverages an AI model to detect Mexican hats and characteristic patterns in wind speed data, which may indicate potential turbine performance anomalies. A time-series analysis-based model to accurately identify these patterns and a specific types of wind gusts.
